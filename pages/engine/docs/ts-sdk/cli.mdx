## The Dubhe CLI

The Dubhe CLI is a development toolkit for building and managing Dubhe projects on the Sui blockchain.

Core features:

1. `schemagen`: Generate Dubhe schemas automatically from your store schemas configuration
2. `publish`: Deploy your Dubhe projects to any Sui network (mainnet/testnet/devnet/localnet)
3. `localnode`: Manage local Sui node for development
4. `faucet`: Interface with Sui faucets to fund addresses on testnet/devnet/localnet

## Installation

The CLI should be installed as a project dependency rather than globally. When you create a new project using `pnpm create dubhe`, the CLI is automatically added as a dev dependency.

## Using the CLI

Some commands expect a dubhe config in the same folder where the CLI is being executed. This includes `schemagen` and `publish`.

`faucet`, and `localnode` can be executed anywhere.

## Commands

### `schemagen`

Generates Store libraries from a `dubhe.config.ts` file. See the [Store Config and `schemagen` documentation](../schemas/config) in the Store section for more details.

```bash
# in a folder with a dubhe.config.ts
dubhe schemagen --configPath dubhe.config.ts
```

### `publish`

Deploy a Dubhe contract project to the Sui blockchain.

This tool will use the `dubhe.config.ts` to detect all systems and schemas to deploy them to the specified network.

When using the deployer, you must set the private key of the deployer using the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. You can make this easier by using [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) before running `dubhe publish` in your deployment script.

Before deploying the contract, please ensure:

1. You have sufficient tokens in your account for deployment fees
2. For testnet/devnet/localnet deployments, you can get test tokens via `dubhe faucet`
3. For localnet deployments, ensure your local node is running

```bash
# to deploy sui locally
dubhe publish --network localnet
# to deploy to sui devnet
dubhe publish --network devnet
# to deploy to sui testnet
dubhe publish --network testnet
# to deploy to sui mainnet
dubhe publish --network mainnet
```

### `localnode`

The localnode command manages your local Sui node using the official `sui` binary.

Local RPC endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:9000`

**Supported subcommands:**

- `start`: Start a local node

  - Optional flag `--background` or `-b`: Run the node in background mode

- `stop`: Stop the running local node
- `status`: Check the local node running status
- `restart`: Restart the local node
  - Optional flag `--background` or `-b`: Run the restarted node in background mode

**Usage examples:**

```bash
# Start a local node
dubhe localnode start

# Start a local node in background
dubhe localnode start -b

# Check node status
dubhe localnode status

# Stop the node
dubhe localnode stop

# Restart the node
dubhe localnode restart

# Restart the node in background
dubhe localnode restart -b
```

Note: Make sure your local node is running properly before using other commands that require a local node (e.g., `publish --network localnet`).

### `faucet`

Connects to a Dubhe faucet service to fund an address.

```bash
dubhe faucet --network <network:testnet/devnet/localnet>
dubhe faucet --network <network:testnet/devnet/localnet> --recipient <address>
```

The default faucet service automatically gives test tokens to accounts in [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

To fund an address on the testnet/devnet/localnet, run `dubhe faucet --recipient <address>`
